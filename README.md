# Customer Retention Analysis using SQL & Excel

## Project Overview
This project analyzes customer transaction data to evaluate retention trends, churn behavior, and customer value for a food delivery platform. Using SQL for data extraction and Excel for dashboarding, it simulates a real-world business scenario similar to Zomato or Swiggy.

## Objective
To identify key customer segments, measure churn rates, and uncover actionable insights that can inform customer retention strategies. The analysis focuses on recency, frequency, monetary value (RFM), and inactivity detection.

## Tools & Technologies
- **SQL (MySQL)** â€“ For querying transactional data
- **Microsoft Excel** â€“ For dashboard creation using PivotTables and charts
- **CSV Data** â€“ Simulated datasets mimicking order behavior

## Dataset Summary
- `customers.csv`: Contains 50 customers with signup dates
- `transactions.csv`: Contains 500+ transaction records including order amount, restaurant, and date

## Key SQL Queries
Queries were written to generate the following insights:
- **Total Orders per Customer** â€“ Identifies high-frequency users
- **Average Order Value (AOV)** â€“ Segments customers by spending behavior
- **Last Order Date (Recency)** â€“ Supports churn detection
- **Churned Customers** â€“ Filters users with no activity in the last 90 days
- **Total Spend** â€“ Estimates individual customer lifetime value

SQL scripts are organized under `/sql_queries/`.

## Dashboard (Excel-Based)

The Excel dashboard summarizes customer transaction data using PivotTables and basic visualizations for high-level understanding. It includes:

- **Customer-wise Total Orders, Spend, and AOV**
- **Bar and Line Charts** visualizing order volume and spend trends
- **Churn vs Active Distribution** (basic illustrative pie chart)
- **Customer Segmentation Table** (count of churned vs active customers)

## Core Insights

- Approximately **10% of customers are churned** (no orders in the last 90 days)
- Customers with **higher order counts tend to spend more overall**
- Top spenders show **moderate retention**, but deeper behavioral patterns are unclear due to limited time-series filtering
- The current dashboard reflects **raw aggregations** without dynamic filters or cohort-level analysis

## Applications
This analysis can support:
- Targeted re-engagement campaigns
- Loyalty program design for high-value customers
- Automated churn detection models
